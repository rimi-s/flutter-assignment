# Flutter Assignment | Essentially AI

> Building a trading application involves a lot of things like the frontend platform, interaction with stock exchanges for placing orders, interaction with banks for fund requirements, user protection features so their trades don't give them wild losses etc...


## Task

> Your task is to build the frontend of an MVP version of this trading app on Flutter which should include the following features.

#### Login screen:
   1. A username and password based login screen.
   2. For the sake of simplicity, if the username == password, allow the user access to further screens.

#### Watchlist screen:
1. This is one of the core components on any trading platform.
2. We'll give you a json with 30 stocks with their tokens and a bunch of other fields which would be completely suffient for this assignment and you would not require any additional data.
3. This screen should have a searchbar and a list of the stocks which are added in the watchlist.
   1. Initially the list should be empty and be populated by the user using the searchbar.
   2. Once a stock is added in the watchist, the list item should contain the ticker of the stock and the LTP (How to get LTP is described below).
4. Create a function to implement the search functionality
   1. Make it closest to the real world scenario without using any external API (all the logic should be in your code).
   2. Think about edge cases like user entering wrong spelling, searching using industry etc...
   3. Upon clicking the search suggestion, the stock should be added in the watchlist.
5. Join the given websocket to display the LTP of the stock on the watchlist. The websocket would be active most of the times, in case there's a downtime, it would be back up in 2 hours.
   1. Here's how you can subscribe and unsubscribe to an instrument's LTP:
   ```
    {
        "Task": "subscribe",
        "Mode": "ltp",
        "Tokens": [3, 7, 13, 17, 19, 22, 25]
    }
    {
        "Task": "unsubscribe",
        "Mode": "ltp",
        "Tokens": [3, 7]
    }
   ```
   2. Display the data received from the websocket on the watchlist corresponding to every stock.
6. Implement a delete from watchlist functionality upon left swipe of the specific stock.
   1. You're supposed to manage the unsubscriptions from websocket as well.

#### Profile screen:
1. There should be a bottom navbar which will enable the user to navigate between profile and watchlist.
2. Additionally, there should be a swipe transition from profile page to watchlist page.
3. Profile page can have static values containing basic details of the user like name, email etc...

## Parameters for evaluation
1. Core functionality
2. Efficiency
3. Exhaustiveness of edge cases
4. Scalability
5. UI/UX Sense
6. Code structure and readability
7. Future use cases (Include it in README)
